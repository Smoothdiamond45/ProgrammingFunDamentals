&nbsp;		Programming Fundatmentals





* variables - 
* are defined in programs
* used to store data
* each have a data type and name
* case sensitive 
* begin with either a letter (preferable, $ or underscore \_ )



we have to use conservatives when programming



they can be any length

they cant contain white spaces, ie number of students -- nunber\_of\_students





Use full words ie use speed and gear not s and g, less confusing for the user and program



If its a one word variable use all lowercase, more then one word capitalise the first letter - its called camelCase





&nbsp;									Types of variables 



Fields are a type of variable, they store values through the object and accessible in the class





Parameters are another type, they receive outside values and help methods complete tasks, but they are short lived

&nbsp;										Data types



when we define a variable we have to give it a data type
